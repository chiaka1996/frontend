## Project Goal

- To build a master class hotel website  showing all the excellent features of the hotel. Making it look as close to the design as possible.

  After the development, users should be able to

  1. View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

  2. See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

- Upload the website to free  theme-selling directories

- Get as many downloads as possible



## Getting Started

The website is quite simple and the technologies used are as follows;

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap

The website used Bootstrap as the only frontend framework

A text editor is needed to code. A browser is needed to test the website. 

#### 										**Style Guide**

**Lay-out**

The design were created to the following width

-  Mobile: 375px
-  Ipad: 767px
-  Desktop: 1440px

**Colors**

- Rgb(134, 3, 45)
- Rgb(255,195,0)
- Rgb(0,0,0)
- Rgb(255, 255, 255)

**Fonts**

Family: Times New Roman

Weights: 300, 400, 600, 700

### **The Design**

 Five designs were sent to the frontend team by the UI/UX designers. These designs were graded by the design team and reviewed by @KingDavid before being sent to the frontend team. Each design was allocated to one group. The design for group 5 can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/wC2vYy8Jzfw0lgOtZ3UxPW/Hotel-Ui?node-id=3%3A2). It was created by @Deji17.

## Workflow from Figma to Coding

#### The objectives guiding the group

- consistency with the design templates
- mobile readiness (responsiveness)
- cross browser consistency
- ease of customizability
- use of high assets

#### Sharing of Tasks

There are 4 pages on the design, the group had an initial population of 5 which was later increased to 14. Each person was assigned a single page to work on and after we all finished the task, we selected the best design with good responsiveness. After the pages have been sorted, three members were selected to clean up and format the code after which the website is tested by all members across all major browsers.

#### Workflow

The group members took their time to analyze and study the design requirements on the [Figma board](https://www.figma.com/file/wC2vYy8Jzfw0lgOtZ3UxPW/Hotel-Ui?node-id=3%3A2). With the help of the designer,  they were able too get the design assets. which were then compressed and put in the `images` folder for easy access to all the members. The project was then initialized on the group's HNG organization repository branch on [Github](https://github.com/hng-teamfury-org/frontend/tree/Group5). Every member then forks the repo and clone it to their local devices to start working on their various tasks. For easier reusability and code compatibility, Bootstrap was agreed on by the members and guidelines to styles in CSS made.

The HTML was first used to structure the page to help the group focus on creating well-structured content. Styling was then added from the top down. 

After each page was created, it was hosted on a server and result was shown to the group. Once the whole group was done with their seperate work, the best designs were picked and pushed to Github. The code was then cleaned up and formatted appropriately. The website was then tested on all major browsers.




## Uploading

The hotel websites are to be uploaded to theme-selling directories for free. The proposed theme-selling directories are 

- [Theme Forest](http://themeforest.net) 
- [Templatic](https://templatic.com)
- [Flippa](https://flippa.com)

Suggestions of other directories can be made to @p_yn3 or @codessage on slack.

## Marketing Strategy

The goal of the marketing team is to increase the number of downloads across all directories to a minimum of 1000. Our target audience is anybody with access to the internet and the ultimate goal is to reach out to organizations in need of websites.]

We intend to make use of social media platforms and digital marketers. The members of **team-fury** are expected to share the download links to all their social media platforms
