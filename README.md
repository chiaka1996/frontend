## Project Goal

- To build a master class hotel website  showing all the excellent features of the hotel. Making it look as close to the design as possible.

  After the development, users should be able to

  1. View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

  2. See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

- Upload the website to free  theme-selling directories

- Get as many downloads as possible



## Getting Started

The website is quite simple and the technologies used are as follows;

- HTML

- CSS

- JavaScript

- Bootstrap framework along with JQuery library.

  A text editor is needed to code. Different browsers are needed to test the website to check for cross-browser compatibility. 

#### 										**Style Guide**

**Lay-out**

The design were created to the following width

-  Mobile: 375px
-  Ipad: 767px
-  Desktop: 1440px

**Colors**

- rgba(91, 14, 34, 0.7) 
- #000000

- ### **The Design**

 Five designs were sent to the frontend team by the UI/UX designers. These designs were graded by the design team and reviewed by @KingDavid before being sent to the frontend team. Each design was allocated to one group. The design for group 2 can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/CypYHHWsaT7rOErPDWMhPx/TheCosmo poiltanHotel?node-id=0%3A1). It was created by @DmaskedOne

## Workflow from Figma to Coding

#### The objectives guiding the group

- consistency with the design templates
- mobile readiness (responsiveness)
- cross browser consistency
- ease of customizability
- use of high assets

#### Collaboration and Sharing of Tasks

There are 4 pages on the design. To make the workflow easy, the project was divided into smaller tasks to be collaboratively worked on by the members to save time. The tasks were divided as follows:- 

● Project Setup

● Header section 

● Footer section 

● Front Page 

● Rooms and Pricing Page 

● Facilities Page 

● Contact Page

 After completion of the tasks, a task force was selected to implement responsiveness to the site The pull requests were made to the Official Team-Fury Group2 branch and merges was done by the Group Lead @Gordie who also deployed the site to [Netlify](https://the-cosmopolitan-hotel.netlify.app) All the pages were reviewed by team mates as each pair posted their work on Github.

#### Workflow

The members of team-fury Group 2 took their time to analyze and study the design requirements on the figma board. With the help of the designer, they were able to get the design assets, which were then compressed and posted in google drive for easy access to all the members. The assets are optimized. The project was then initialized on the HNG organization repository on [Github](https://github.com/hng-teamfury-org/frontend/tree/Group2). Every member of the group then fork the repo to start working on their various subtasks.

For easier reusability and code compatibility, Bootstrap was agreed on by the members, and guidelines to styles in css made. The HTML was first used to structure the page to help the group focus their attention on creating well-structured content, taking into consideration, mobile first approach development. Then styling to the appropriate pages was done, reiterating the styling process to perfectly replicate the design. 

Once a subgroup is done with their task, they push to github then make PR which is merged by the team's git manager. After this, every other team would then update the branch to avoid conflict. Finally the code is cleaned up and formatted appropriately.


## Uploading

The hotel websites would be uploaded to theme-selling directories for free. The proposed theme-selling directories are 

- [Theme Forest](http://themeforest.net) 
- [Templatic](https://templatic.com)
- [Flippa](https://flippa.com)

Suggestions of other directories can be made to @p_yn3 or @codessage on slack.

## Marketing Strategy

The goal of the marketing team is to increase the number of downloads across all directories to a minimum of 1000. Our target audience is anybody with access to the internet and the ultimate goal is to reach out to organizations in need of websites.

We intend to make use of social media platforms and digital marketers. The members of **team-fury** are expected to share the download links to all their social media platforms
