## Project Goal

- To build a master class hotel website  showing all the excellent features and services offered by the hotel making it look as close to the design as possible.

  1. View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

  2. See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

- Upload the website to free  theme-selling directories

- Get as many downloads as possible



## Getting Started

The website is quite simple and the technologies used are as follows;

  ### **The Design**

 Five designs were sent to the frontend team by the UI/UX designers. These designs were graded by the design team and reviewed by @KingDavid before being sent to the frontend team. Each design was allocated to one group. The design for group 1 can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/CypYHHWsaT7rOErPDWMhPx/TheCosmo poiltanHotel?node-id=0%3A1). It was created by @BigJoe

###  **Frontend Functionality**

- The landing page has a well displayed navigation bar to guide users through a range of services offered by the hotel.
- Users can also browse through the image gallery to see different sizes of rooms and rates, and also book reservations. 
- All users should be able to view the pages of the website optimally irrespective of their device screen size.
-  All functionalities/elements work appropriately as designed.
- A Bug free website

## Workflow from Figma to Coding

#### The objectives guiding the group

- consistency with the design templates
- mobile readiness (responsiveness)
- cross browser consistency
- ease of customizability
- use of high assets

#### Sharing of Tasks

To be able to finish the project on time, group 2 which comprises of sixteen (16) members was divided into pairs and responsibilities assigned to each pair.

- @Chimdia and @Zinnie designed the **Contact Page**
- @Alphajeez and @Felisto designed the **Landing Page**
- @Saviee and @Ouko designed the **Facilities Page**
- @QueenMercy and @Funshi designed the **Rooms Page**
- @Jahsom and @Akuragba @Elion worked on **Navigation**
- @Nyior and @Sophyia worked on **Accessibility**
- @_OR and @Denniman worked on **Documentation**
- @Ndonna worked on **Responsiveness**

#### Workflow

The team carefully analyzed the Hotel website model assigned to her. Division into pairs was an in-house decision and duties were delegated to each pair.

First two (2) days were assigned purely to replicating the model into lines of codes. Outputs were shared by each pair through netlify, reviews came in handy as errors were detected and possible fixes were suggested which include uniformity in font style to be same as the Design Model, color and major emphasis placed on mobile users as this is the most common device used.

Responsiveness was taken as a priority as all hands were on deck to assist @Ndonna to achieve this task.

A final review was done and pairs made a Pull Request of their codes to the group's repo [branch](https://github.com/hng-teamfury-org/frontend/tree/master/Group1)


## Uploading

The hotel websites would be uploaded to theme-selling directories for free. The proposed theme-selling directories are 

- [Theme Forest](http://themeforest.net) 
- [Templatic](https://templatic.com)
- [Flippa](https://flippa.com)

Suggestions of other directories can be made to @p_yn3 or @codessage on slack.

## Marketing Strategy

The goal of the marketing team is to increase the number of downloads across all directories to a minimum of 1000. Our target audience is anybody with access to the internet and the ultimate goal is to reach out to organizations in need of websites.

We intend to make use of social media platforms and digital marketers. The members of **team-fury** are expected to share the download links to all their social media platforms
